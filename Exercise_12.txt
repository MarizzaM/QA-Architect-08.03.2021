a)If a class is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from the final class

b)Some classes perform standard functions and they are not meant to be modified e.g. 
classes performing various functions related to string manipulations or mathematical functions etc.

 Sometimes we write classes which perform various authentication and password related functions 
 and we do not want them to be altered by anyone else.
