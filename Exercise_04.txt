Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Polymorphism uses attributes and methods from inheritance to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
