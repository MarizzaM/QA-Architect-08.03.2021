Using @Override annotation
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Polymorphism uses attributes and methods from inheritance to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

===7===
a) Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
b) Yes

===8===
a) Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
b) No
c) Only signature

===9===
a) No
b)  In Java, we can have an abstract class without any abstract method. This allows us to create classes that cannot be instantiated but can only be inherited.
